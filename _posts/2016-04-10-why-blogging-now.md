First answer: because I have more time now, after wrapping up a 30 month intensive engagement in a startup I co-founded, [audyx](http://www.audyx.com/en "audyx - the first online audiology platform"){:target="_blank"}. Unfortunatly, I had to step out and I've decided together with some of the best individuals I've worked with the past years to focus on other people projects. So [Shefing](http://www.shefing.com "Innovation as a service") is back, offering our experience and talent to others.

This blog is actually our first step in sharing our experience, that can be summarized as catching on to the right trends, taking advantage of the new concepts and technologies, once again. We will write about the cloud, [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), the evolution of the web, agility,  UX,  quality, compliancy... This blog is a good exercise for us to crytallize our own learnings and also to expose it to our audience. 

Thanks to [Benjamin](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/benjaminstanislas){:target="_blank"} and [Maxime](https://il.linkedin.com/in/leadlike/en){:target="_blank"} for the advise.
